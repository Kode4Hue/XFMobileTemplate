# XFMobileTemplate
A Xamarin Forms Mobile Solution Template based on the principles of Clean Architecture. Feel free to grab it and use on your next Xamarin Forms Project.

**Disclaimer**
* This project was created with the intention of helping peope scaffold Xamarin Forms boilerplate code quicker with the principles of Clean Architecture intact. 
* This template aims to reflects the princples of clean architecture, however, some principles will be implemented or improved over time.

### Intented Use Cases: 
* Use this template as the foundation for creating Large/Enterprise-Grade Mobile Applications using Xamarin.
* Use this Mobile App Template for reducing the need to write boilerplate code
* Use this template in scenarios where a development team seek to future-proof their Xamarin Forms codebase for easier transition to .NET MAUI.

### Clean Architecture Layers:
* Presentation:
  * XfMobileTemplate.Presn
  * XfMobileTemplate.Presn.Android
  * XfMobileTemplate.Presn.iOS
* Infrastructure:
  * XfMobileTemplate.CA.Infrastructure
* Application:
  * XfMobileTemplate.CA.Application
* Domain
  * XfMobileTemplate.CA.Domain

### Credits:
* This template is highlighly influenced by [Jason Taylor](https://github.com/jasontaylordev)'s [SPA Clean Architecture Solution Template].
* Credits to [Khary Sharpe(https://www.linkedin.com/in/kharysharpe/) for introducing me to the concept of Clean Architecture back in 2015.
* Credits to the great [Uncle Bob](http://cleancoder.com/) for So providing amazing Enducational content on the concept of Clean Architecture. It has helped so many developers like myself understand how to write quality and maintainable code.
